# Vanilla TS Starter

This template provides plain TypeScript project boilerplate code, along with the CIS-1962 ESLint rules.

# Development

To get started, first run `npm i` to install dependencies.

To start `nodemon`, which will re-run your code on every file update, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

To make a production build, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with all your TypeScript code transpiled to JavaScript. `npm start` should now work.
